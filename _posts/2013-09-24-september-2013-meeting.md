Dysfunctional expatriot @buzzdecafe will be headlining tonight's @HartfordJS.

He will be winging a last-minute "presentation" he was buffaloed into doing by @WillSlab, after several others declined. @buzzdecafe felt pity over the ongoing symptoms of oxygen deprivation exhibited by @WillSlab since his return from Colorado.

Food will be served, and we're returning to Axis901 for the 3rd month straight.
