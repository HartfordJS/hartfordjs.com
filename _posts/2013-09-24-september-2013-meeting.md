Noted functional expert and author @buzzdecafe will be headlining tonight's @HartfordJS.

Already famous for his mini-Scheme implementation in Javascript, he helped build, not one, but two of the most stupendously popular functional programming libraries used today.  Yes, this is the man behind both Eweda and Ramda!  But not content to rest on his laurels, buzzdecafe went on to take the Erlang world by storm and is now reinventing gaming on the mobile phone.

!! Rebuttal Description !!

Dysfunctional expatriot @buzzdecafe will be headlining tonight's @HartfordJS.

He will be winging a last-minute "presentation" he was buffaloed into doing by @WillSlab, after several others declined. @buzzdecafe felt pity over the ongoing symptoms of oxygen deprivation exhibited by @WillSlab since his return from Colorado.

Food will be served, and we're returning to Axis901 for the 3rd month straight.
