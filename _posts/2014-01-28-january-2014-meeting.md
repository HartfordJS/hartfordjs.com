This month's meeting will feature a talk on Functional Programming in Javascript delivered by Scott Sauyet.

If you don't know Scott, here is a brief bio:

"Scott Sauyet has been programming 15 years, in recent years focusing on Javascript on both the client and server.  A big fan of functional programming, he is currently working on a functional programming library for Javascript." 

Food will be served, and weâ€™re returning to Axis901 again!
