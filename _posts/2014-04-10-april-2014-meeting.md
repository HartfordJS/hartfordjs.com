For our one-year anniversary, we've summoned [Will Klein](http://willkle.in) to return home and share his JavaScript adventures at [Rally Software](http://rallysoftware.com). We'll hear about how Rally does (exhaustive) front-end testing in JavaScript. We will be serving Jasmine, Sinon, and CoffeeScript!

We're hoping to make this a celebration, so if anyone would like to bake cake or other desserts, let [us](mailto://us@hartfordjs.com) know!

Invite your friends and please [RSVP](http://hartfordjs.eventbrite.com)!
