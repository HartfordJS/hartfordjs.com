HartfordJS will be suspending our regularly scheduled programming to do a combined meeting with the Connecticut Java Users Group! Come here Reza Rahman, Java EE/GlassFish evangelist, talk about [Using Javascript Rich Clients with Java EE](http://www.slideshare.net/reza_rahman/javaee-javascript). You can find more from Reza on his [blog](https://blogs.oracle.com/reza/).

Following Reza's talk, our own Michael Hurley, c0-creator of the [Ramda](https://github.com/CrossEye/ramda) functional programming library, will be doing a talk [Applicatives](http://buzzdecafe.github.io/code/2014/08/12/applicatives-ramda-style/) and other algebraic types.
