Come hear Michael Hurley, co-creator of the [Ramda](https://github.com/CrossEye/ramda) functional programming library, talk about the rapid transition from a fun project to the role of "library maintainer". We may all build small projects and share, not knowing what it would be like if they gain rapid popularity.

See some of Mike's work and/or musings on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/buzzdecafe) and his [GitHub](http://buzzdecafe.github.io/) blog.
