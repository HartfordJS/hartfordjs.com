Come hear Scott Sauyet and Michael Hurley, creators of the [Ramda](https://github.com/CrossEye/ramda) functional programming library, talk about the rapid transition from a fun project to the role of "library maintainer". We may all build small projects and share, not knowing what it would be like if they gain rapid popularity. 

Mike will also be doing a talk [Applicatives](http://buzzdecafe.github.io/code/2014/08/12/applicatives-ramda-style/) and other algebraic types. 

See some of Mike's work and/or musings on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/buzzdecafe) and his [GitHub](http://buzzdecafe.github.io/) blog. More of Scott can be found at his [GitHub](https://github.com/CrossEye) page.
