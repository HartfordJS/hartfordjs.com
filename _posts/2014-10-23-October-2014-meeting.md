HartfordJS is back to our usual schedule and in our usual location this month! Our next meeting will be on Thursday, October 23. 

This month's presentation will be done by Scott Sauyet, co-creator of the [Ramda](https://github.com/CrossEye/ramda) functional programming library. He will be doing a talk on the shift from side project to library maintenance. 

See some of Scotts's work and/or musings on his [website](https://scott.sauyet.com) and his [GitHub](http://github.com/CrossEye) page. 

Invite your friends and please RSVP at [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/hartfordjs-october-2014-tickets-13664993363)!
