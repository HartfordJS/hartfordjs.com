HartfordJS is back to our usual schedule and in our usual location this month! Our next meeting will be on Wednesday, March 4th.
This month's presentation will be done by [Will Klein](http://willkle.in/), founder of HartfordJS and developer at Rally Software in Colorado. Come see Will on his visit back to snowy New England!!

**How to ReactJS**

React is a UI library for building reusable components from Facebook and Instagram. Specifically the V in MVC, React can be integrated with other frameworks like Angular or Backbone, or coupled with Flux (also from Facebook). We'll learn what problem React solves and how it simplifies UI development. Beyond why it's totally awesome, we'll also learn how to start building UI components in React.

**Tooling is Awesome**

Our developer workflow should not only be efficient, but fun to use. Building on our hello world app in React, let's "mature" our workflow and tooling for the real world. We'll explore package management and tasking with npm, transpiling JS and bundling assets with webpack, and other related tools. While using the React example for a use case, most of this will be React-agnostic.

*Will Klein is an engineer at Rally Software (Denver) and a connoisseur of JavaScript frameworks. Learn more about him at http://willkle.in.*
